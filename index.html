					<p>
						A Garry's Mod server addon that connects in-game text chat with Discord
						for cross-communication between them. It also supports custom commands
						that can be executed in Discord to perform actions in-game.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						This project heavily uses the Discord API and optimized networking to
						keep the two separate services in sync with minimal performance impact.

						A Garry's Mod server addon that allows Expression 2 chips to create and manipulate
						user interfaces using the Derma and VGUI libraries.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						While this may not seem like much, it becomes more impressive when learning that Expression 2
						chip cores only run on the server side, meaning that all UI elements must be created and maintained
						over the network. This requires clever manipulation of the information that is networked.

					<p>
						An OpenGL program that can load 3D Wavefront OBJ files and render them in a window,
						with texture support. It has a basic physics engine using the

						<span><a href="https://www.ode.org/" class="colored" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)</a></span>,

						and a modular entity system that allows for easy addition of new objects with custom behaviors.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						This was made as an experimental playground to dive into 3D graphics and physics engines, as well as
						implementing an object system for Object Oriented Programming in a language with no objects!

					<p>
						A Discord bot that allows users to upload and download large files much larger than
						Discord supports. In theory, files are also stored more securely because of them being encoded.

						With both a custom upload and download command files can be sent and received directly with the bot's filesystem.

						Information about uploaded files is also stored on Discord within the message content, so virtually no disk space or
						database space is used by the bot.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						The file size limitation is bypassed by splitting files into chunks and converting each chunk into
						a binary image, where black pixels represent 1's and white pixels represent 0's. Red pixels are used to
						detect the end of a chunk.
